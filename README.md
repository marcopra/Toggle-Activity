# FGSM Attack and Toggle Activity

The main goal of these experiments is to analyze the effects of a particular adversarial attack - the
FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign method) Attack - on a given Deep Neural Network. The network used
in these experiments is a pre-trained Res-net 18 network [1].
During the experiment, we are considering mainly the effects of the attack on the Toggle Activity
and on the Neural Ranking to understand if it is possible to create a dataset that solicits many
different paths of the network, using a few images.

Please take a look to my [Report][!], where is explained my experiment.

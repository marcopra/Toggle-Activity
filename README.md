# FGSM Attack and Toggle Activity

The goal of the experiment is to analyze the effects of a particular adversarial attack - the
FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign method) Attack - on a given Deep Neural Network. The network used
in these experiments is a pre-trained Res-net 18 network.
During the experiment, we are considering mainly the effects of the attack on the Toggle Activity
and on the Neural Ranking to understand if it is possible to create a dataset that solicits many
different paths of the network, using a few images.

Please take a look to my [Report](https://github.com/marcopra/Toggle-Activity/blob/main/FGSM_attack_and_toggle_activity.pdf), where my experiment is explained.
